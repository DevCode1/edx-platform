EdX offers certificates for every course. Your certificate shows that you completed a course successfully.

EdX offers two types of certificates: honor code and verified.

***********************
Honor Code Certificates
***********************

Honor code certificates are free of charge to all students and are available for all courses. 

***********************
Verified Certificates
***********************

Verified certificates are available for select courses. When you register for a verified certificate, edX requires that you periodically submit pictures of yourself and verification that you're the one completing the course work. The cost of a verified certificate varies between courses.

To see whether a course offers verified certificates, check the course About page.

Receiving a Certificate

Certificates are distributed shortly after a course ends.
