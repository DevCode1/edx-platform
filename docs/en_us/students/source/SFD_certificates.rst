Certificates
########################

EdX offers certificates for nearly every course. Your certificate shows that you completed a course successfully. The certificate includes your name, the name of the course, and the edX partner university that created the course, such as HarvardX. It also includes the names of some members of the course team.

Because edX courses are not credit-bearing courses, the certificate doesn't include a grade or specify the number of credit hours that the course might earn in a university. Additionally, transcripts are not available for edX course work.

.. note:: Your certificate lists the full name that appears on your dashboard, so make sure that name is correct. To change your full name, go to your dashboard, and then click **edit** under **Full Name** in the left pane.

****************************
Selecting a Certificate Type
****************************


EdX offers three types of certificates: honor code, verified, and XSeries.

Honor code and verified certificates show that you've completed a single honor code or verified course. An XSeries certificate shows that you've completed a series of courses, known as an XSeries.

The type of certificate appears in a color-coded tag under the course image on your dashboard:

.. note:: A very small number of courses offer the option to audit the course. These courses have the same rigorous material as other edX courses, but no certificates are available. If you want evidence that you completed the course, you can print a copy of your **Progress** page.


=========================
Honor Code Certificates
=========================

Honor code certificates are free of charge to all students and are available for all courses except the small number of audit-only courses. When you register for a course, you register for an honor code certificate by default.

When you register for an honor code certificate, you have access to all course materials, and you can participate as much, or as little, as you like. There is no penalty for registering for an edX course and not completing the assignments or exams.


=========================
Verified Certificates
=========================

Verified certificates show not only that you successfully completed your edX courses, but also that you've verified your identity by using a webcam and an official ID from your country or region. You may want to work toward a verified certificate if you plan to use your course for job applications, promotions, or school applications. 

Verified certificates are available for a fee that varies by course. The fee helps support edX and other students. If you want to help support edX and other edX students, you can choose to pay more than the minimum required fee. For more information about the fee for a particular course, see the About page for that course.

When you register for a verified course, you'll use a webcam to submit a photo of yourself and of an official ID to edX's secure authorization service. We encrypt your photos and use the highest levels of security available to protect your data. During the course, you may be asked to use the same method to re-verify your identity periodically. If your computer doesn't have a webcam, you can submit the photos from a different computer. 

For more information about registering for a verified certificate and paying the fee, see :ref:`SFD_registration`. For a list of all courses that offer verified certificates, see the `edX course catalog <https://www.edx.org/course-list/allschools/verified/allcourses>`_.

If you have a question or an issue with billing for a verified certificate, contact us at `billing@edx.org <mailto://billing@edx.org>`_. Include your order number, but please **do not include your credit card information**.

=========================
XSeries Certificates
=========================

XSeries certificates show that you've successfully completed a series of courses that make up an XSeries. The XSeries certificate doesn't indicate whether you earned an honor code certificate or a verified certificate for each individual course. 

****************************
Changing a Certificate Type
****************************

You may register for one type of certificate but later decide that you want a different type of certificate. For example, you may register for an honor code certificate, but you might later want to change to a verified certificate. You can change the certificate type until registration for verified certificates ends for your course, usually two or more weeks after the course starts. 

* To upgrade to a verified certificate, go to your dashboard, and then click **Challenge Yourself!** under the name of your course. You'll then follow the onscreen instructions to register for a verified certificate. 

  If registration for verified certificates has closed, you can't change your certificate type. Registration for verified certificates typically closes after at least one assignment due date has passed.

* To change to an honor code certificate, **instructions?**. If you want a full refund for the cost of your verified certificate, you must change to an honor code certificate before verified certificate registration ends for your course. After registration for verified certificates has ended, you can still change to an honor code certificate, but you cannot receive a refund.

*************************
Receiving a Certificate
*************************

Certificates are distributed shortly after a course ends--usually within two weeks. After the course ends, you'll see the following message under the course name on your dashboard:

``Final course details are being wrapped up at this time. Your final standing will be available shortly.``

When your certificate is ready, you'll see your final grade for the class as well as a link to your certificate.

If you want a paper copy of your certificate, you can click **Download Your Certificate** to download and print the certificate from your dashboard.

.. note:: Your certificate will include your full name, so make sure that this is correct.

Receiving Certificates for Self-Paced Courses
=============================================

.. Are there any self-paced courses? Last I heard there was some controversy about this; that was a couple of months ago at least...
