Certificates
########################

EdX offers certificates for nearly every course. Your certificate shows that you completed a course successfully.

Certificates don't list a grade or number of credit hours.

A very small number of courses offer an option to audit the course. These courses have the same rigorous material as other edX courses, but no certificates are available. If you want proof that you participated in the course, you can print a copy of your **Progress** page. 

*To audit: Register for the course on our website. For most courses (all courses except verified certificate courses) you do not need to specify an audit track. You will have access to videos, lectures, readings, etc., and can participate as much, or as little, as you like. There is no penalty for registering for an edX course and not completing the assignments or exams.*

We don't offer transcripts for any courses (they're not credit-bearing)

From edX and the university (ex. edX and MITx, edX and HarvardX)

****************************
Selecting a Certificate Type
****************************


EdX offers three types of certificates: honor code, verified, and XSeries.

Certificates don't mean course credit

Honor code and verified for single courses; XSeries for series of courses

You can see the type of certificate on your dashboard:

=========================
Honor Code Certificates
=========================

Honor code certificates are free of charge to all students and are available for all courses except the small number of audit-only courses. 



=========================
Verified Certificates
=========================


Verified certificates show not only that you successfully completed your edX courses, but also that you've verified your identity by using a webcam and an official ID from your country or region. You may want to work toward a verified certificate if you plan to use your course for job applications, promotions, or school applications. 

Verified certificates are available for a fee that varies by course. The fee helps support edX and other students. If you want to help support edX and other edX students, you can choose to pay more than the minimum required fee. For more information about the fee for a particular course, see the About page for that course.

When you register for a verified course, you'll use a webcam to submit a photo of yourself and of an official ID to edX's secure authorization service. We encrypt your photos and use the highest levels of security available to protect your data. During the course, you may be asked to use the same method to periodically re-verify your identity. If your computer doesn't have a webcam, you can submit the photos from a different computer. 

For more information about registering for a verified certificate and paying the fee, see :ref:`SFD_registration`. For a list of all courses that offer verified certificates, see the `edX course catalog <https://www.edx.org/course-list/allschools/verified/allcourses>`_.

If you have a question or an issue with billing for a verified certificate, contact us at `billing@edx.org <mailto://billing@edx.org>`_. Include your order number, but please **do not include your credit card information**.

=========================
XSeries Certificates
=========================

XSeries certificates are earned by successfully completing a series of courses that make up an XSeries.


****************************
Changing a Certificate Type
****************************

You may sign up for an honor code certificate and later want to change to verified - can do this for up to two weeks, but not after due dates for assignments have passed

You can upgrade to a verified certificate as long as verified certificate registration is open for your course. Simply click the “challenge yourself” button seen on your dashboard.

You have until verified registration ends for your course, a minimum of two weeks from the course start date, to upgrade or downgrade your selected choice. You can get a full refund up until then. After verified registration closes, we can no longer provide a refund.


*************************
Receiving a Certificate
*************************

Certificates are distributed shortly after a course ends--usually within two weeks. After the course ends, you'll see the following message for the course on your dashboard:

``Final details are being wrapped up at this time...``

When course certificates are ready, you'll see a link to your certificate in this space. (see the certificate available for download)

*Does the user just see a link, or an image of the certificate?* 

**Image of example certificate (see Mark's docs week of 6/30) - need HC and verified**


No printed copies; you can print your PDF copy (and if you lose your printed copy, you can print another one from your dashboard)

.. note:: Your certificate will include your full name, so make sure that this is correct.

Receiving Certificates for Self-Paced Courses

``Final details are being wrapped up at this time...`` is confusing for these courses
