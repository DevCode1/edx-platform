=====================================
Define Course-Wide Discussion Topics as Cohorted
=====================================

All courses include a page named **Discussion**. When you create a course, a
discussion topic named "General" is available for you to include by default.
You can add more course-wide discussion topics to guide how students share and
find information during your course. Such course-wide topics might include
Feedback, Troubleshooting, or Technical Help. Discussions in these topics can
begin as soon as your course is available.
