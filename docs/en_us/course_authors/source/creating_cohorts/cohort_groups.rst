##########################################
Using Cohorts to Build Course Communities
##########################################

a group of students who move through an educational 
program together
communicate with each other and share experiences privately, in discussions

encourage learning through collaboration


For options you can use to run and moderate discussions, see the following

Cohort Groups
********************************

private and specialized cohorts

all automated & random assignment: 
large course, take their estimated enrollment size and divide it by 10,000 to get the number of cohorts that are appropriately sized (target 200-400 active students in each cohort). 

A typical goal of cohorts in a course is to provide consistent supportive interactions among students, 

all manual assignment:
small course, cohorts are created based on some known criteria (in this case, company or organization) and then students are manually assigned to this cohort by course staff using their user names or email addresses 

mixed:
define a single cohort for automated assignment, so that most students are placed into that chort. define other cohorts for manual assignment, such as students from a single company or students who are members of an alumni association

********************************
Configuring Cohorts
********************************

All cohort configs:

1. Studio Turn it on (cohorted)
2. Studio (optional) define some general discussion topics (cohorted_discussions): Announcements, FAQ, Errata, Troubleshooting. So that you only have to post once to them to reach all students.

To set up auto: 

3. Studio turn it on (auto_cohort)
4. Studio define the cohort groups (auto_cohort_groups)
   
To set up manual-only cohorting:

3. LMS define cohort groups
4. LMS assign students to cohort groups

assignment occurs when each student visits the discussion page

To set up hybrid:




.. _Enable Cohorts:

#. Click **Save Changes**.

what that means and words. you are not done


=====================================
Define Cohorted Course-Wide Discussion Topics
=====================================

All courses include a page named **Discussion**. When you create a course, a
discussion topic named "General" is available for you to include by default.
You can add more course-wide discussion topics to guide how students share and
find information during your course. Such course-wide topics might include
Feedback, Troubleshooting, or Technical Help. Discussions in these topics can
begin as soon as your course is available.

All content-specific discussion topics, which you add to your course outline in discussion components, are cohorted.
